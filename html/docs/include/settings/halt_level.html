<p>This setting allows you to configure a mask that determines
whether, and which, notices and/or warnings get converted to errors. You can
configure notices and warnings that are generated by PHP, and notices and
warnings that you generate yourself (by means of trigger_error()). For example,
to convert the warning of strlen() (without arguments) to an error, you would
do:</p>
<pre>
ini_set('xdebug.halt_level', E_WARNING);
strlen();
echo "Hi!\\n";
</pre>
<p>Which will then result in the showing of the error message, and the abortion
of the script. <code>echo "Hi!\\n";</code> will not be executed.</p>
<p>The setting is a bit mask, so to convert all notices and warnings into
errors for all applications, you can set this in php.ini:</p>
<pre>
xdebug.halt_level=E_WARNING|E_NOTICE|E_USER_WARNING|E_USER_NOTICE
</pre>
<p>The bitmask only supports the four level that are mentioned above.</p>
