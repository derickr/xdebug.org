<p>This setting determines the name of the file that is used to dump
garbage collection statistics into. The setting specifies the format with format specifiers, very
similar to sprintf() and strftime(). There are several format specifiers
that can be used to format the file name.</p>

<p>See the [CFG:trace_output_name] documentation for the supported
specifiers.</p>
